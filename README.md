## Components
- **app-root** - The main root component that loads the application.
- **RestaurantComponent** - Displays a list of restaurants with a grid layout and allows toggling items in the wishlist.
- **MenuComponent** - Shows menu items for a selected restaurant.
- **CartComponent** -Displays items added to the cart, quantity controls, and the total cost. Contains a checkout button to submit the order to the API.

## Services

**CartServiceService** -
Manages cart state, including items, quantities, and total count. It also handles checkout by sending data to the mock API and clearing the cart after a successful order.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Usage

- **Restaurant Browsing** -
Restaurants are displayed in a grid layout.
Users can click on a restaurant to view its menu.
The toggleWishlist feature allows adding/removing restaurants from the wishlist.
- **Adding Items to Cart** -
Users can add menu items to the cart with a single click.
Quantities can be adjusted in the cart view.
Real-time price calculation reflects total cost instantly as items are updated.
- **Checkout** -
Clicking the Checkout button submits the order to a mock API endpoint.
Cart is cleared after successful submission.

## Wishlist Feature
Restaurants can be added to a wishlist by clicking the wishlist icon. The toggleWishlist method manages the addition and removal of items from the wishlist.
**Wishlist Logic (In RestaurantComponent)** 
The toggleWishlist function adds a restaurant to the wishlist or removes it if already added. This is controlled by toggling the isFavorite boolean.

## Cart and Checkout
**Cart Logic (In CartServiceService)** - 
The CartServiceService is responsible for:
- Adding items to the cart.
- Updating quantities of items.
- Calculating and broadcasting cart count and total.
**Real-Time Price Update** -
In CartComponent, the cartItems$ observable tracks items in the cart, and the total is recalculated whenever the cart contents are updated.

**Checkout**
The checkout function in CartComponent sends the order details (name, quantity, and price) to Mock API and clears the cart upon completion.
